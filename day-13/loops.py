    Python Loops
    Python has two primitive loop commands:

    while loops
    for loops
"""
# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

# The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.
# With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1

# With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)

# With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")

    _summary_
    Python For Loops
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in 
other object-orientated programming languages.
With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  
# Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:
for x in "banana":
  print(x)

# With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break

# Exit the loop when x is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    break
  print(x)

# With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)

# To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,
# The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.
